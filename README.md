# Full Stack Java Script Project 5

This project mirrored the Treehouse Project 10 that I did previously.  In it, I used fetch methods to take data from an API and populate a field of cards.  For extra credit I made sure that the cards could be searched and that the user could rotate through the cards using the right and left arrows.
